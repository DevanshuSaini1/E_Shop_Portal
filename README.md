# E_Shop_Portal
This project is created during my IITK(Kanpur) Full Stack Web Developer Course.
An E-shop portal is an online platform that allows businesses to sell products or services directly to consumers. It features product listings, shopping cart functionality, secure payment gateways, and user accounts, enabling customers to browse, select, and purchase items easily.
